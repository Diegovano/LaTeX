\maketitle

Intellectually very curious, I am a quick learner and have taught myself how to
program in \texttt{C++} and \texttt{HTML}. I’m generally very interested in understanding how
things work, ranging from macroeconomics to scientific subjects. I am now studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London. I am
passionate about ultra-realistic computer simulators (e.g., piloting
an Airbus A320 on Lockheed Martin’s Prepar3D software). I’m also a native
speaker of English and French, and studied Spanish many years.
