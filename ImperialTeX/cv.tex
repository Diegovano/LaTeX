\maketitle

Intellectually very curious, I am a quick learner and have taught myself how to
program in \texttt{C++} and \texttt{HTML}. I’m generally very interested in understanding how
things work, ranging from macroeconomics to scientific subjects. I am now studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London.

I am
passionate about ultra-realistic computer simulators (e.g., piloting
an Airbus A320 on Lockheed Martin’s Prepar3D software), which gives my a unique insight into how the details of what is often hidden behind the flight deck door. I’m also a native
speaker of English and French, and studied Spanish many years.

\section{Extra-Curricular}

\cvlistitem{Completed a two-week internship at PLP Labs, a team within the experts at PLP Architecture, whose large projects include 22 Bishopsgate, the tallest skyscraper in the City of London, or the Nova Victoria development at the heart of Victoria. PLP Labs's objective is to develop smarter buildings using innovative techniques such as machine learning. My work focused on the theme of the ``Future of Education'', and how a school could look like in the future.}
